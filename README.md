**Goje** (Persian for "tomato") is a highly configurable Pomodoro timer designed to boost your productivity. Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, Goje allows you to set custom durations for each work session and break, making it flexible to suit your workflow.  

For example:  
- Session 1: 30 minutes work, 5 minutes short-break  
- Session 2: 45 minutes work, 10 minutes short-break  
- Session 3: 60 minutes work, 20 minutes long-break  
- And so on...  

## Inspiration 🌱  
This project is inspired by the article [How to overcome resistance and get into deep focus (Pomodoro 2.0)](https://beyondproductivity.substack.com/p/how-to-overcome-resistance-and-get), which explores techniques for overcoming procrastination and improving productivity.
